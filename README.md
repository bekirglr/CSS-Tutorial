I made small examples and explanations about general properties of CSS,Flexbox, MediaQueries and Responsive designs.

#What is Media Query?

-Media queries is a feature of CSS 3 allowing content rendering to adapt to different conditions such as screen resolution (e.g. mobile and desktop screen size).

#What is CSS Flexible Box Layout?

-CSS Flexible Box Layout, commonly known as Flexbox, is a CSS 3 web layout model. The flex layout allows responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending upon screen size (or device).
